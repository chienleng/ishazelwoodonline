					<h5>What is Hazelwood?</h5>
					<p>Hazelwood Power Station is a brown coal burning power station located in the heart of the Latrobe Valley in Victoria, Australia.</p>
					<p>Built between 1964 and 1971, the 1,600 megawatt capacity power station is made up of eight 200 MW units, and, prior to its 2017 closure, supplied up to 25% of Victoria's electricity and more than 5% of Australia's total energy demand.</p>
					<p>At 1,558 kg of CO<sub>2</sub>
						for each megawatt hour of electricity 'sent out', Hazelwood is one of the highest polluting power stations in the world.</p>

				<div className="question">
					<h5>Where does the data come from?</h5>
					<p>Every 5 minutes the <a href="http://aemo.com.au/">Australian Energy Market Operator</a> publishes the <a href="http://www.nemweb.com.au/REPORTS/CURRENT/DispatchIS_Reports/">average energy</a> generated by each significant power station in the National Electricity Market. You can dive deep into this data with the fantastic <a href="https://nationalmap.gov.au/renewables/">Australian Renewable Energy Mapping Infrastructure</a> project.</p>
					<p>For a background on emissions intensity of coal fired power stations, including the emissions factor of 1,558 kg CO<sub>2</sub>/MWh for Hazelwood, see this excellent <a href="http://theconversation.com/factcheck-have-eight-of-australias-12-most-emission-intensive-power-stations-closed-in-the-last-five-years-65036?">FactCheck</a> by Dylan McConnell.</p>
					<p>For raw information on the other nasty emissions (hydrochloric acid, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, lead, sulfuric acid, arsenic and, unfortunately, much more) check out the <a href="http://www.npi.gov.au/npidata/action/load/individual-facility-detail/criteria/state/VIC/year/2013/jurisdiction-facility/00004337">National Pollutant Inventory</a>. Here we use the 2013 reported figures â€” the numbers were much worse in 2014 due to the month-long mine fire in 2014, the last year for which figures are available.</p>
				</div>
				<div className="question">
					<h5>Have any other coal fired power plants closed down recently in Australia?</h5>
					<p>Certainly. Hazelwood is just the most recent. Since 2012 nine other coal-fired power stations have been retired: Wallerawang (1000&nbspMW), Energy Brix (170 MW), Playford (240&nbspMW), Redbank (151&nbspMW), Anglesea (150&nbspMW), Collinsville (190&nbspMW), Munmorah (1400&nbspMW), Northern (520&nbspMW), Swanbank B (480&nbspMW).</p>

					<h5>How do I learn more about clean energy?</h5>
					<p>A great place to start is Giles Parkinson's excellent site <a href="http://reneweconomy.com.au/">RenewEconomy</a>.</p>
				</div>
				<div className="question">
					<h5>Do we have an energy crisis in Australia?</h5>
					<p>No. While it's true that we don't have any more cheap gas and there are some real issues with our energy markets, we're not about to run out of energy this year, or next, or the year after.</p>
					<p>But as long as our politicians keep treating energy as a political plaything, we all stand to lose.</p>
